 (** Dispatches an event (or event like object) and calls all listeners
     listening for events of this type. The type of the event is decided by the
     type property on the event object.
     
     If any of the listeners returns false OR calls preventDefault then this
     function will return false.  If one of the capture listeners calls
     stopPropagation, then the bubble listeners won't fire. *)

(**
   Removes an event listener from the event target. The handler must be the
   same object as the one added. If the handler has not been added then
   nothing is done.
   @param type The type of the event to listen for.
   @param handler The function to handle the event. The
   handler can also be an object that implements the handleEvent method
   which takes the event object as argument.
   @param opt_capture In DOM-compliant browsers, this determines
   whether the listener is fired during the capture or bubble phase
   of the event.
   @param opt_handlerScope Object in whose scope to call the listener.

(**
   This implements the EventTarget interface as defined by W3C DOM 2/3. 
   The main difference from the spec is that
   the this does not know about event
   propagation and therefore the flag whether to use bubbling or capturing 
   is not used. 
   Another difference is that event objects do not really have to implement 
   the Event interface. 
   An object is treated as an event object if it has a type property. 
   It also allows you to pass a js_string t instead of an event object and 
   in that case an event like object is created with the type set 
   to the js_string t value.
   Unless propagation is stopped, events dispatched by 
   an EventTarget bubble to
   its parent event target, returned by getParentEventTarget.
   To set the parent event target, call setParentEventTarget or override 
   getParentEventTarget in a subclass.
   Subclasses that don't support changing the parent event target should
   override the setter to throw an error.
